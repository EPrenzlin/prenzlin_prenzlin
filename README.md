This application was created for a ficticioius boutique Investment Bank. It is intended to act as an internal Employee database whereby the employees are able to assign and create new clients to themselves, be able to edit the attributes of those clients, and also be able to view and search for other employees within the company. 

Upon being 'hired' into the bank, users are required to sign-up; they are requried to provide a username, password, confirm their title and the division in which they work for. Upon succesfully creating a new username, the user will be directed to the log-in page, where they must enter the details once more to gain entry into the Employee database
